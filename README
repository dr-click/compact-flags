CompactFlags comes to serve models with several boolean flags. in large data 
volumes where the flags can be used to slice the data in several ways. queries tend
to be heavier and more indexes are needed by time.

this plugin is made so it can store several flags in one integer attribute through bit wise operations. the attribute represents the state of each record. And is much more performant 
in database queries
